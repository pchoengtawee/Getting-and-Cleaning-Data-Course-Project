Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Data for the project:

Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

R Script:
#1 First clean up the workspace and check the working directory to make sure that all of text files are save in the current working directory. Next, use read.table() to read into tables:
- features.txt
- activity labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt
# This section, printing the above tables is optional. It is a good habit to check the result of your script before writing the script for next steps.

#2 Create column names by using conames()

#3 Merge the training and test sets to create one data set. Again, printing TrainRawdata table, TestRawdata table and All_TrainTest_Data table to check my result.

#4 Convert comlumn 2 of features and labels to string

#5 Extract only measurement on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

#6 Add label and convert data to factor

#7 write a new table name "Final_tidy_data"
