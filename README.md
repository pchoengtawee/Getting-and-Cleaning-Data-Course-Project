# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Overview:
This Repo is a course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course authorized by Johns Hopkins on Coursera. This project demonstrates a ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The aim is to prepare tidy data that can be used for business analysis.

Course Work:
The goal is to R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Additional Information:
The detail information about the variables, data and R Script are provided in CoodeBook file.
